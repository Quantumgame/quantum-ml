## Notes on Convolunional Neural Networks

They are the state of the art architecture for image classification. They apply filters to raw pixel data to learn higher level features. CNN consist of three main types of layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers** : they apply convolutional filters to the image
2. **Pooling Layers** : downsamples the data from the convolutional layers to reduce the computation time
3. **Dense Layers** : they perform the actual classification. In a dense layers, every node of one layers is connected to every node in the preceding layer
